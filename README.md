# Typographix Blog

This blog project will be a way for us to master Flexbox and responsive design. We will also have an architecture with multiple HTML pages that we will navigate between. We will work on this project twice after creating it to add dark mode functionality, skeleton screen loading animations, and re-factor it using SCSS architecture.
